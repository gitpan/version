	    Document the above.

	* lib/version.pm
	  lib/version/vxs.pm

	* README
	  lib/version/vxs.pm
	  lib/version.pm

	* README
	    Describe minor changes

	* lib/version/vxs.pm
	  lib/version.pm
	    Bump $VERSION.

	* vutil/vutil.c
	    Eliminate code I'm never going to use.

jpeacock  r193):

	* lib/version.pod
	    PAUSE does so support version objects.  Elaborate on support
	    for Module::Build and lack thereof for ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

jpeacock  r185):

	* version/vxs.pm
	    Forgot to bump this.  When am I going to have inherited props?

jpeacock  r184):

	* Build.PL
	    Explicit minimum version of Module::Build.  Fixes
	    <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=16249>

	* README
	    Whoo-hoo!  Remember to update this the first time.

	* lib/version.pm
	    Make sure that there is no possible way that Perl will
	    try to include the non-existant pure Perl vpp.pm

	* lib/version.pod
	    Complete rewrite that is hopefully easier to understand.

jpeacock  r183):

	* vutil/vutil.c
	    Use trinary operator to choose power of 10, rather than pow(),
	    which caused some problem with AIX 5.1.  Resolves:

	      <https://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=15254>

	* t/02derived.t
	    Suppress unnecessary warning when overriding qv() sub.

	    Remember to update this for 0.49 release.

jpeacock  r181):

	Fix Build.PL so Win32 will compile properly

jpeacock  r180):

	* version/Build.PL
	    Explicit call to dist_name to help Windows DTRT.  Resolves
	    ticket:

	      <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=14743>

	* lib/version/vxs.pm
	  lib/version.pm
	  lib/version.pod
	  t/01base.t
	  t/02derived.t
	  t/coretests.pm
	  vutil/vutil.c
	    Change implementation to return version objects instead of
	    version::vxs object.  Document that qv() isn't inherited and
	    give work around.  Update tests to no longer test version::vxs
	    class directly (since it doesn't work).  Resolves ticket:

	      <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=14958>

jpeacock  r177):

	Start POD rewrite.

jpeacock  r176):

	Significant archectectural change (object hash has to contain
	reference to array not the array itself); see

	    <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=14439>

	for details.  Initial changes to support pure Perl variant
	(not included yet), see

	    <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=14417>

	for more details.  All POD moved to seperate file.  Tests
	abstracted out for reuse by different classes.

jpeacock  r165):

	"version" element of hash must be a reference, see:
	   <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=14439>
	for details.

	Also, function name changes backported from bleadperl version.

jpeacock  r164):

	Badly written subclasses could SEGV (reported by Andreas Koenig).
	Now all version objects are validated before use.

	Add vverify() function to validate version objects and include
	it before each use of a version object.  Add tests for poorly
	written subclass that tickle the above function.

	Apply const'ifying from bleadperl and reformat calls to
	sv_[cat|set]pvf to be consistent with bleadperl source.

jpeacock  r163):

	Leading whitespace or lack of leading zero caused the the object
	to be initialized incorrectly (reported by Andreas Koenig).

	Added POD for subclassing.  Removed cruft from README file.

jpeacock  r162):

	Don't strip trailing zeros unneccesarily

jpeacock  r161):

	Spelling fixes from "Piotr Fusik" <pfusik@op.pl>

jpeacock  r160):

	Complete rename of files to prevent GCC 4.0 bug

jpeacock  r159):

	Preliminary commit for rename of util.[ch]

jpeacock  r158):

	Final changes to release 0.43 to CPAN

	*   README, lib/version.pm
	    Bump $VERSION number

	*   t/01base.t
	    Test that single term version expands to triplet for
	    $v->normal.  Eliminate "Exporter" from derived class.

	*   util/util.c
	    Various const'ifying to match Perl's own changes.
	    Handle short and really short array outputs in vnormal().

	*   util/util.h
	    const'ify Perl_scan_version().

jpeacock  r157):

	Complete rewrite of parser to handle CPAN-style (two significant
	decimal) versions, as well as finish documenting the changes.

	*   util/util.c
	    Simplify parser to just count digits when parsing numeric
	    versions.

	*   lib/version.pm
	    Rewrite documentation on Numeric Alpha Versions and make all
	    examples consistent.

	*   t/01base.t
	    Add additional tests for CPAN-style alphas as well as
	    object->new().

jpeacock  r156):

	*   lib/version.pm
	    Revised POD to correspond to new behavior with regards to both
	    Quoted Versions and Alpha Versions.

	*   lib/version.xs
	    Extend new() to be callable as an object method.
	    Copy existing object if called as object method with no
	    parameter.

jpeacock  r155):

	Working towards a release to CPAN.

	*   README
	    lib/version.pm
	    First pass at documenting the external changes.

	*   t/01base.t
	    Since vcmp() is working again, can restore the minimum to the
	    use line.

	*   util/util.c
	    Finish up handling for vcmp to deal with alpha versions.

jpeacock  r154):

	Almost completely working; only the comparison tests with
	non-objects is still failing.

	*   lib/version.xs
	    Simplify is_alpha() now that it is just as hash flag.

	*   util/util.c
	    Manually create and copy the hash elements when creating new
	    object from old object.
	    Forgot to make sure to display all subversion from short
	    numeric versions.

jpeacock  r153):

	Completed (?) to move to Module::Build

	*   lib/typemap
	    lib/version.xs

	    New M::B file

	*   version.xs
	    Try and deal with case where no parameter was passed to new()

	*   util.c
	    Changes to access hash-based object (vcmp still busted)

	*   t/01base.t
	    Changed to prevent core dump (temporarily)

jpeacock  r151):

	Implement alpha versions using secret array zero slot to
	differentiate between two place alphas (1.02_03) and three place
	alphas (1.002_03) so that versions which only use two significant
	places normally will still sort correctly with their alpha
	versions.

	*  util.c
	   (Perl_scan_version): Somehow manage to both simplify and
	   complicate the code at the same time.
	   (Perl_vnumify): use the new zero'th array element to distinguish
	   between 2 and 3 significant decimal places for printing.

jpeacock  r150):

	*  util.c
	   Handle two digit alpha versions
	   Once a v-style or FP, always a v-style or FP

	    AvReal_on required to fix problems under threaded Perl
	    Slight rewrite of loop code to fix compiler bug on OS X
	    Display alpha versions properly

	*   version.xs
	    new() returns void since it actual returns on the stack

jpeacock  r146):

	*    util.c
	     Fix infinite loop for CVS-style versions of more than 3
	     decimal places.
	     Thanks to Richard Evans <richard_david_evans@yahoo.co.uk>

	*    t/01base.t
	     Test to make sure above doesn't happen again.

	*    lib/version.pm
	     Increment the $VERSION again.

	*    README
	     Remember to update this before releasing (for a change).

jpeacock  r144):

	*    lib/version.pm
	     Increment $VERSION number; have to quote to get the tgz file
	     named correctly (isn't that what this module is supposed to
	     fix?)

	*    version.xs:UNIVERSAL_VERSION()
	     Check for null sv before attempting sv_derived_from()
	     Thanks to Marcus Holland-Moritz <mhx-perl@gmx.net> for finding
	     this.
