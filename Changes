2007-04-17  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Neglected to delete or comment out a $DB::single (again).

2007-04-17  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	One last place that needed a leading 'v' (for non-magic v-strings).

2007-04-17  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	v-string created version objects always stringify with a leading 'v' for
	consistency's sake, since we have no way of knowing whether one was present
	for 5.6.0 <= Perl < 5.8.1 (non-magic v-strings).

2007-04-17  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	When copying an existing version object, forgot to copy the original string
	representation.

2007-04-14  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Return original string value for all stringification cases except for
	qv(1.2) which returns 'v1.2' for roundtrip purposes.

2007-04-12  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Output the original string form for numeric versions for XS code now.
	Ready to release to CPAN.

2007-04-12  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	It will be less surprising to overload string comparisons (now that the
	default stringification is identical to the initializer) than it would be
	to not overload them.

2007-04-11  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Better way to handle the undef initialization case.

2007-04-11  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Disallow string comparisons with version objects.  Tests adjusted to use
	numeric comparisons only.

2007-04-11  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Cache the original string used to initialize the version object and return
	that when stringifying.  Only works with pure Perl class for the moment.

2007-03-18  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Add more text to README on v-string support.

2007-03-18  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Now supports non-magical v-strings (Perl 5.6.0-5.8.0)!
	Polymorphic error messages from 5.6.0 onwards.

2007-03-10  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Polymorphic error messages work everywhere except XS under 5.6.2. :(

2007-03-10  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Polymorphic error messages now working (and tested) in pure Perl module.

2007-02-13  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Don't need to explicitely specify the MAN3POD stuff, since EU::MM will now
	do that automatically (since the POD is mentioned in PM).
	Actually, magic v-strings came in at 5.8.1, not 5.8.0 (spotted in the
	bleadperl variant).

2007-02-12  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Final 0.70 release to CPAN.

2007-02-08  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Error out on malformed input 1._1 (Andy Armstrong <andy@hexten.net>).

2007-02-08  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Backport bleadperl changes.

2007-02-08  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Prepare for another alpha release to CPAN

2007-02-08  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Apply more const'ifying and code cleanup from bleadperl.

2007-02-07  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Better regex to handle weird exponential notation under 5.6.x on OSX.

2007-02-05  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Suppress installation (but test anyways) in bleadperl or better.

2007-01-30  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Bump $VERSION's and update README for another dev release [0.69_02]

2007-01-30  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	XS UNIVERSAL::VERSION code now emits error messages just like the release of
	Perl it is compiled against.

2007-01-30  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Need to limit the effects of the WARN handler.
	Stop testing v-strings in Perl 5.6.x until XS code is up to snuff.

2007-01-30  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Complete rewrite of tests to confirm that version::vpp mirrors the
	different Perl releases' error messages.

2007-01-30  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Carefully replicate [almost] all error messages exactly as different Perl
	releases would otherwise report.  Resolves RT#24675 (once the tests are
	adjusted).

2007-01-27  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Improve documentation of v-strings as version initializers.

2007-01-27  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Testing with Module::Build revealed problems with the boolean overload.

2007-01-27  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Fix Makefile.PL to work correctly with 5.6.x and 5.005x.
	Tests with bare v-strings can now handle 5.6.x releases.
	Pure Perl release now includes same overloading as XS.

2007-01-10  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Rewrite Makefile.PL again before releasing 0.69 to CPAN.

2007-01-09  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Before releasing to CPAN, make sure to remove stale Makefile.* remnants
	from previous runs (in case someone tries to rebuild with the pure Perl
	release after building the XS release).

2007-01-08  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Release 0.69 to CPAN

2007-01-08  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Try to make the Makefile.PL more forgiving about evil compilers (RT#24283).
	Eliminate Scalar::Util from pure Perl version (for Jos <kane@xs4all.nl>).
	Latest ppport.h (newer is better, right?).
	Resolve RT#24239 and 24244, related to PERL_DONT_CREATE_GVSV.

2006-11-23  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Replace checks with Test::More with a custom module (so the tests won't
	break when Test::More gets updated).

2006-10-29  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Release 0.68 to CPAN with locale tests.

2006-10-08  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	I was wrong.  Apparently all releases of Perl require you to force the PV
	to be regenerated after changing the locale.

2006-10-08  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Lots of changes.  Problems noted in bleadperl because of locales which use
	commas for the decimal point.  Both XS and Perl code updated to handle
	this, which was tricky for the latter because locale handling was so bad
	prior to 5.8.0.  Harmless warning during testing caused by bad interaction
	between POSIX and Test::More's AUTOLOAD (no idea how to fix it).

	Also bumped up required versions in tests and updated Makefile.PL to
	correctly install the POD file.

2006-08-16  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Use default subclass name in Build.PL, since M::B nukes the version::
	namespace during its own initialization.

2006-08-08  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Revert accidental whitespace change

2006-08-08  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	One more regex to prevent patch files being added to MANIFEST

2006-08-08  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Dependency on changelog not in correct order with dist

2006-08-08  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Yet another way to structure Makefile.PL so that it autogenerates Changes.

2006-08-08  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Once again, fix very small version handling in pure Perl release (globally
	this time).

2006-07-30  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Property change (don't need these to be executable).

2006-07-30  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Add MANIFEST.SKIP so Module::Release will be happy.
	Hide vutil/Makefile.PL inside top level Makefile.PL (__DATA__).

2006-07-30  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Force MSVC to only compile, not link, by default.
	Generate manified PODs in Makefile.PL.
	Autogenerate 'Changes' from Makefile.PL.

2006-07-25  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Pure Perl UNIVERSAL::VERSION was throwing undef warnings when called
	without a req, e.g. MODULE->VERSION.

2006-07-25  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	More compatibility for inclusion in Module::Build.
	Remove dependency to Scalar::Util (just guess if it is a v-string).

2006-07-19  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	More Makefile tweakage.  Can't use warnings in Perl < v5.6.0 and need to
	protect Build.PL from being run by Makefile.PL being a little too helpful.

2006-07-17  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Custom Makefile.PL left debris around if ExtUtils::CBuilder, confusing the
	Makefile into trying to compile/link something that wasn't there.

	Also, take out the "0+" numification, which didn't work in vpp.pm, and which
	I don't want to support with this module anyway.

2006-07-17  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Reorganize structure and provide a fully EU::MM compatible Makefile.PL
	for, among other cases, bootstrap installing of Module::Build (which now
	depends on version.pm).  No new tests, no change to core code.  Resolves
	RT#20493.

2006-06-08  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Bump version in preparation for release to CPAN as 0.64.

2006-05-29  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	As it turns out, the import() method *can* be inherited and DTRT.
	POD adjusted to reflect the current reality.

2006-05-29  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Based on a suggestion by David Wheeler, test for already exported qv() in a
	more inheritance friendly fashion.

	Create a way to call the base import() from a subclass and have it DTRT and
	provide documentation for doing so.

	Ready to release to CPAN as 0.63_01.

2006-05-27  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Release to CPAN as 0.63 (no really!).

2006-05-27  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Prevent XS from issuing warnings when initializing with undef or no
	parameter at all.

	Release to CPAN as 0.63.

2006-05-27  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Fix RT 19517 - need to handle 'undef' as a string.
	Release to CPAN as 0.62.

	TODO - leaking undef warnings from the XS code

2006-05-23  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Use even newer ppport.h, per Marcus Holland-Moritz.
	Bump $VERSION for release to CPAN as 0.61.

2006-05-22  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	In my haste to jettison Exporter, I neglected to consider that someone
	might try and load version.pm twice.  Fixed (and tested).

2006-05-20  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Replace ppport.h with much improved version.
	Strip out my pathetic compatibility code (see above).
	Add dependency to ppport.h to each file with appropriate #define's.
	Release to CPAN as 0.60.

2006-05-18  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Prep for another beta to CPAN

2006-05-18  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Integrate upstream bleadperl changes.
	Add compatibility code to vutil.h until ppport.h catches up.
	Fix (and test for) the case where class->VERSION is called

2006-05-16  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Now works with 'require version' and not just 'use version' (with tests).
	Pure Perl UNIVERSAL::VERSION now operates correctly when used as a fallback
	inherited class method, e.g. class->VERSION or $obj->VERSION.

2006-05-14  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Fix reported failures with UNIVERSAL::VERSION as fallback method in vpp.pm.
	Augment new() to try and spot non-magic v-strings for v5.6.2 - v5.8.1.

2006-05-05  john_peacock

	Prep beta release to CPAN.

	Improve POD on using modules that use version.pm.
	New tests.
	Require pure Perl module for 5.005_03 (for now).

2006-05-05  john_peacock

	Tweak ppport.h #define's to support 5.0005_04

2006-05-05  john_peacock

	Rewrite to remove dependency on Exporter.
	Fix RT#19017 - problems related to very small version numbers.

2006-04-06  john_peacock

	Not sure if this works on 5.005_03 after all

2006-03-27  john_peacock

	Complete compatibility with Perl 5.005_0x as well as 5.6.2.
	Remove the compatibility warnings.pm (since it was a bad idea).
	Release to CPAN.

2006-03-27  john_peacock

	Fix the pure Perl release for 5.005_0x (thanks to Nick Ing-Simmons).
	Ready for release to CPAN.

2006-03-27  john_peacock

	Restore compatibility with Perl 5.6.x (though not with 5.005_x yet).

2006-03-09  john_peacock

	* lib/version.pod
	    Minor POD fixup (revealed by pod2html).

	* t/coretests.pm
	  t/01base.t
	  t/02derived.t
	    Suppress status messages except when --verbose is used.

2006-02-26  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Release 0.57 to CPAN.  Only bumps $VERSION and slightly improve Build.PL.

2006-02-20  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Next beta release to CPAN.

	* Build.PL
	    Subclass Module::Build and override have_c_compiler() with one that
	    fails without die'ing.

	* README
	  lib/version.pm
	  vperl/vpp.pm
	  vutil/vxs.pm
	    $VERSION++.

	Beta release to CPAN.

	* README
	  lib/version.pm
	    Bump $VERSION for new release.

	* vperl/vpp.pm
	    Fully implemented UNIVERSAL::VERSION in the pure Perl module.
	    Set explicit $VERSION so that correct module gets loaded during
	    testing.

	* vutil/vxs.pm
	    Set explicit $VERSION so that correct module gets loaded during
	    testing.

	* t/coretests.pm
	    Additional tests (based on bleadperl t/op/use.t).

2006-02-19  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Another workaround for incomplete testing

2006-02-17  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Emergency release to fix up M::B 0.2611 problem

2006-02-16  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Neglected to clean up after XS code (since we are playing games).

2006-02-16  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	No, really, the final changes before releasing to CPAN. :(

2006-02-16  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Final updates for 0.54 release to CPAN.

2006-02-14  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Merge from version-combined branch.  Equivalent to RELEASE_0_53_03.

2006-02-09  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Commit changes prior to push to implement pure Perl alternative.

	* Build.PL
	    Need to exclude building on all 5.9.x bleadperl releases.

	* lib/version.pod
	    Forgot a quote in one of the example code fragments.

	* vutil/vutil.c
	    Sync with bleadperl.  Only warn if 'use warnings' is set.

2006-01-10  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Release 0.53 to CPAN.

	* vutil/vutil.c
	    warn() when initialization string contains trailing characters
	    (rather than silently ignoring them).  Suggested by David Wheeler.

	* t/coretests.pm
	    Test the above change.

	* README
	    Document the above.

	* lib/version.pm
	  lib/version/vxs.pm
	    Bump $VERSION.

2006-01-06  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	New version to deal with malformed input data that came up
	in bleadperl:

	  sprintf of version objects
	  <https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=37897>

	* README
	  lib/version/vxs.pm
	  lib/version.pm
	    Bump version.

	* vutil/vutil.c
	    Die if input value has underscore but no decimal.

	* t/01base.t
	  t/02derived.t
	    Use no_plan so I don't need to increment tests any more.

	* t/coretests.pm
	    Check for malformed input.

2006-01-05  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Ready for new release to CPAN with minor changes.

	    Describe minor changes

	* lib/version/vxs.pm
	  lib/version.pm
	    Bump $VERSION.

	* vutil/vutil.c
	    Eliminate code I'm never going to use.

2005-12-03  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	* lib/version.pod
	    PAUSE does so support version objects.  Elaborate on support
	    for Module::Build and lack thereof for ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

2005-12-02  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	* version/vxs.pm
	    Forgot to bump this.  When am I going to have inherited props?

2005-12-02  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	* Build.PL
	    Explicit minimum version of Module::Build.  Fixes
	    <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=16249>

	* README
	    Whoo-hoo!  Remember to update this the first time.

	* lib/version.pm
	    Make sure that there is no possible way that Perl will
	    try to include the non-existant pure Perl vpp.pm

	* lib/version.pod
	    Complete rewrite that is hopefully easier to understand.

2005-11-01  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	* vutil/vutil.c
	    Use trinary operator to choose power of 10, rather than pow(),
	    which caused some problem with AIX 5.1.  Resolves:

	      <https://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=15254>

	* t/02derived.t
	    Suppress unnecessary warning when overriding qv() sub.

2005-10-10  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	* version/README
	    Remember to update this for 0.49 release.

2005-10-08  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Fix Build.PL so Win32 will compile properly

2005-10-06  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	* version/Build.PL
	    Explicit call to dist_name to help Windows DTRT.  Resolves
	    ticket:

	      <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=14743>

	* lib/version/vxs.pm
	  lib/version.pm
	  lib/version.pod
	  t/01base.t
	  t/02derived.t
	  t/coretests.pm
	  vutil/vutil.c
	    Change implementation to return version objects instead of
	    version::vxs object.  Document that qv() isn't inherited and
	    give work around.  Update tests to no longer test version::vxs
	    class directly (since it doesn't work).  Resolves ticket:

	      <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=14958>

2005-09-26  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Start POD rewrite.

2005-09-14  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Significant archectectural change (object hash has to contain
	reference to array not the array itself); see

	    <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=14439>

	for details.  Initial changes to support pure Perl variant
	(not included yet), see

	    <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=14417>

	for more details.  All POD moved to seperate file.  Tests
	abstracted out for reuse by different classes.

2005-09-07  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	"version" element of hash must be a reference, see:
	   <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=14439>
	for details.

	Also, function name changes backported from bleadperl version.

2005-08-23  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Badly written subclasses could SEGV (reported by Andreas Koenig).
	Now all version objects are validated before use.

	Add vverify() function to validate version objects and include
	it before each use of a version object.  Add tests for poorly
	written subclass that tickle the above function.

	Apply const'ifying from bleadperl and reformat calls to
	sv_[cat|set]pvf to be consistent with bleadperl source.

2005-08-22  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Leading whitespace or lack of leading zero caused the the object
	to be initialized incorrectly (reported by Andreas Koenig).

	Added POD for subclassing.  Removed cruft from README file.

2005-08-03  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Don't strip trailing zeros unneccesarily

2005-08-02  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Spelling fixes from "Piotr Fusik" <pfusik@op.pl>

2005-07-23  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Complete rename of files to prevent GCC 4.0 bug

2005-07-23  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Preliminary commit for rename of util.[ch]

2005-06-06  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Final changes to release 0.43 to CPAN

	*   README, lib/version.pm
	    Bump $VERSION number

	*   t/01base.t
	    Test that single term version expands to triplet for
	    $v->normal.  Eliminate "Exporter" from derived class.

	*   util/util.c
	    Various const'ifying to match Perl's own changes.
	    Handle short and really short array outputs in vnormal().

	*   util/util.h
	    const'ify Perl_scan_version().

2005-05-23  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Complete rewrite of parser to handle CPAN-style (two significant
	decimal) versions, as well as finish documenting the changes.

	*   util/util.c
	    Simplify parser to just count digits when parsing numeric
	    versions.

	*   lib/version.pm
	    Rewrite documentation on Numeric Alpha Versions and make all
	    examples consistent.

	*   t/01base.t
	    Add additional tests for CPAN-style alphas as well as
	    object->new().

2005-05-20  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	*   lib/version.pm
	    Revised POD to correspond to new behavior with regards to both
	    Quoted Versions and Alpha Versions.

	*   lib/version.xs
	    Extend new() to be callable as an object method.
	    Copy existing object if called as object method with no
	    parameter.

2005-05-17  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Working towards a release to CPAN.

	*   README
	    lib/version.pm
	    First pass at documenting the external changes.

	*   t/01base.t
	    Since vcmp() is working again, can restore the minimum to the
	    use line.

	*   util/util.c
	    Finish up handling for vcmp to deal with alpha versions.

2005-05-17  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Almost completely working; only the comparison tests with
	non-objects is still failing.

	*   lib/version.xs
	    Simplify is_alpha() now that it is just as hash flag.

	*   util/util.c
	    Manually create and copy the hash elements when creating new
	    object from old object.
	    Forgot to make sure to display all subversion from short
	    numeric versions.

2005-05-15  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Completed (?) to move to Module::Build

	work on new hash-based object (all tests do not suceed)

	*   Makefile.PL
	    Replace ExtUtils::MakeMaker with Module::Build wrapper

	*   Build.PL
	    New M::B file

	*   version.xs

	    Changed to prevent core dump (temporarily)

2005-05-08  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Implement alpha versions using secret array zero slot to
	differentiate between two place alphas (1.02_03) and three place
	alphas (1.002_03) so that versions which only use two significant
	places normally will still sort correctly with their alpha
	versions.

	*  util.c
	   (Perl_scan_version): Somehow manage to both simplify and
	   complicate the code at the same time.
	   (Perl_vnumify): use the new zero'th array element to distinguish
	   between 2 and 3 significant decimal places for printing.

2005-04-21  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	*  util.c
	   Handle two digit alpha versions
	   Once a v-style or FP, always a v-style or FP

	*  t/01base.t
	   Altered tests to match new expectations

2005-02-06  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	*   Makefile.PL

	    Correctly compare to numified version (instead of stringified)

	*   util.c
	    Use same code as bleadperl
	    AvReal_on required to fix problems under threaded Perl
	    Slight rewrite of loop code to fix compiler bug on OS X
	    Display alpha versions properly

	*   version.xs
	    new() returns void since it actual returns on the stack

2004-07-12  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	*    util.c
	     Fix infinite loop for CVS-style versions of more than 3
	     decimal places.

	*    t/01base.t
	     Test to make sure above doesn't happen again.

	*    lib/version.pm

	     Remember to update this before releasing (for a change).

2004-07-11  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	*    lib/version.pm
	     Increment $VERSION number; have to quote to get the tgz file
	     named correctly (isn't that what this module is supposed to
	     fix?)

	*    version.xs:UNIVERSAL_VERSION()
	     Check for null sv before attempting sv_derived_from()
	     Thanks to Marcus Holland-Moritz <mhx-perl@gmx.net> for finding
	     this.

	*    Makefile.PL
	     Add new target to automatically generate the 'Changes' file.

	*    util.c
	     (Perl_scan_version): rewrite code to use AV * instead of SV *
