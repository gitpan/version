	Implement alpha versions using secret array zero slot to differentiate
	between two place alphas (1.02_03) and three place alphas (1.002_03) so
	that versions which only use two significant places normally will still
	sort correctly with their alpha versions.
	
	*  util.c
	   (Perl_scan_version): Somehow manage to both simplify and complicate
	   the code at the same time
	   (Perl_vnumify): use the new zero'th array element to distinguish between
