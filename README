version 0.36
====================

Provides the same version objects as included in Perl v5.9.0 (and hopefully in
the 5.10.0 release).  In fact, if you attempt to use this module with a version
of Perl >= v5.9.0, this module will not do anything, since the code already
exists in the Perl core.

Now includes a subclass, version::AlphaBeta, which demonstrates using
alphanumeric version strings, instead of strict numeric versions.  Also a
new qv() operator which can be used to force a version to be interpreted
not as a floating-point value (especially useful with older versions of
Perl).

IMPORTANT NOTE: the replacement UNIVERSAL::VERSION method supplied by this
module currently leaks memory, so don't call it in a loop in your code
until this has been corrected (this is a very uncommon mode of operation,
so it is not as serious a problem as it could be otherwise).

Please read the POD documentation for usage/details.
